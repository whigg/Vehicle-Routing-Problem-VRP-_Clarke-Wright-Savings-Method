# Vehicle-Routing-Problem-VRP-_Clarke-Wright-Savings-Method
 Clark-Wright Savings algorithm for Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) with single depot and vehicle capacity constraints.
 
 In one of my courses, we were asked to manually solve a vehicle routing problem (a kind of optimization problem) . It turns out I don't want to manually solve it, so I wrote this code. It has each step reported. Feel free to use it for your own purpose.
