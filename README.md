# Vehicle-Routing-Problem-VRP-_Clarke-Wright-Savings-Method
 Clark-Wright Savings algorithm for Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) with single depot and vehicle capacity constraints.
 
 In one of my courses, we were asked to manually solve a vehicle routing problem (a kind of optimization problem) . It turns out I don't want to manually solve it, so I wrote this code. It has each step reported. Feel free to use it for your own purpose.
 
A complete description of Single Deport VRP can be found here:
http://web.mit.edu/urban_or_book/www/book/chapter6/6.4.12.html\

In order to get the code run, you need 2 input files in .csv format:
- Nodes' distances to depot and the demand on them.
- Pairwise distances between nodes. If your nodes are in coordinate format, you can actually convert them to pairwise easily using other tools.

I have the sample data files uploaded here. They correspond to the textbook link above, so that you can check if the results are correct.
